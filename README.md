# Retail Sales Forecasting Project

## Overview
This project aims to forecast retail sales using machine learning techniques. The primary objective is to predict future sales based on historical data, helping businesses make informed decisions about inventory, staffing, and marketing. The dataset contains features such as sales over time, promotional events, holidays, and store information. 

## Project Structure

- `Retail_Sales_Forecast_.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook that contains all the steps for data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and sales forecasting.
- `Data`: The dataset used for the project includes sales data from various retail stores over time. It includes information about sales, promotions, holidays, and other external factors that impact sales.
- `Models`: This project utilizes machine learning models for time series forecasting and regression.
- `Results`: This section of the project evaluates the performance of different forecasting models and their effectiveness in predicting future retail sales.

## Key Features

- `Data Preprocessing`: Handling missing data, feature engineering, and time series preparation.
- `Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)`: Analysis of sales trends, seasonality, and the impact of external factors such as holidays and promotions.
- `Forecasting Models`: Several machine learning models are trained to predict sales, including:
  - Linear Regression
  - ARIMA
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
- `Evaluation Metrics`: The models are evaluated using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error).

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or any IDE that supports Jupyter notebooks

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ChrisChukwunyereNwaiwu/Retail-Sales-Forecast.git
    cd Retail-Sales-Forecast
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Retail_Sales_Forecast_.ipynb
    ```

## Usage
This project can be used to forecast retail sales by following these steps:
- Load the dataset and preprocess it for time series analysis.
- Train the models on historical data to predict future sales.
- Evaluate model performance using RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.
- Visualize the predictions and adjust the model as needed.

## Results

The models produce forecasts for future retail sales based on past sales patterns. The results are compared across different models, with ARIMA and XGBoost showing promising results with lower error rates.

## Future Work

- Experiment with other advanced time series forecasting models like Prophet or LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory).
- Integrate real-time data to provide dynamic sales forecasting.
- Extend the analysis to include additional external data such as weather or economic indicators.
